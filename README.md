Efficiency Analysis of Bi-LSTM for Malayalam Word Segmentation: A Comparative Study

In this project, word segmentation was implemented using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) with the tagging scheme B (Beginning), I (Inside), E (End), and S (Single). The Bi-LSTM captures long-range dependencies, HMM models sequential data probabilistically, and CRF optimizes the entire tag sequence jointly, resulting in accurate word segmentation for natural language processing tasks.
